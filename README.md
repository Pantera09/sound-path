  When performing non-destructive testing of welding utilizing the Ultrasonic method, trigonometry is essential for accuracy. In angle beam testing or shear wave, a soundwave is introduced into a medium (a metal), at an angle beyond the angle of incidence (0 or 90 degrees), namely 45, 60 or 70 degrees. The soundwave bounces from the bottom of the material to the top of the material at a 45, 60 or 70 degree angle to find a flaw in the weld or the base material and sends a signal back for evaluation.
  
  That is a very basic description of how ultrasound is utilized to verify the soundness of a weld. Before the digital age UT scopes or guages were analog using a cathode ray tube for the screen. They had very little adjustments and everything including the trigonometry of UT was performed manually. With the introduction of the digital ultrasonic flaw detectors, everything can be done by the scope. 
  
  Being a firm believer that by performing the functions, calculations and measurements makes for a better technician the art of flaw detecting is slowly fading away.
  
  My purpose for the creation of an application is to assist the digital technician in the field with references that are usually and most often perishable. References for the steps in the calibration of a unit, Codes and standards pertaining to UT, the science of sound and velocity in a given material and more.
  
  Using the sound path section of the application will show a graphic representation of the the sound wave travel and location of a suspected flaw in any AWS joint configuration where the geometry of a joint will impact the travel of sound.
